        <h2>What will your Web site include (graphics, text, links, audio, video, etc.)?</h2>
          <p>It will definitely need pictures of the animals on the subpage of adoptable pets. Perhaps making some kind of logo graphic would be a good idea. Homepage will need a big eye catching image banner similar to that of <a href="https://www.mlar.org" target="_blank">Main Line Animal Rescue.</a><p>
          <p>I suppose also some text is needed but it will probably be more image focused. The text would mainly be to describe the shelter, its history, and the pets.</p>


        <h2>How will your Web site look (the interface, colors, layout, etc.)?</h2>

         <p>I think I want to keep a warm color scheme. Using the Palleton wesbsite I tentatively am thinking about a color scheme grouping based off...</p>
         <ul>
           <li style="color: #C1C943;">THESE</li>
           <li style="color: #CC9844;">THREE</li>
           <li style="color: #CC6744;">COLORS</li>
         </ul>

        <p>I think probably I will do the navigation horizontally at the top, a big main banner type image, then probably split into a 2/3 1/3 structure, then go back to one block at the bottom for the footer. That would all be light background. The nav might be light text on dark background. I'll also do a wrapper and maybe a gradient on the background.
