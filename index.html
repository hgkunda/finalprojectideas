        <h2>What will your Web site include (graphics, text, links, audio, video, etc.)?</h2>

            <p>It will definitely need pictures of the animals on the subpage of adoptable pets. Perhaps making some kind of logo graphic will be a good idea. Homepage will need a big eye catching image banner similar to that of <a href="https://www.mlar.org" target="_blank">Main Line Animal Rescue.</a><p>

            <p>I suppose also some text is needed but it will probably be more image focused. The text will mainly be to describe the shelter, the history, and the pets.</p>

            <p>The links will be to other information, other shelters, and news in general.</p>


          <h2>How will your Web site look (the interface, colors, layout, etc.)?</h2>

             <p>I think I want to keep a warm color scheme. Using the Palleton wesbsite, I tentatively am thinking about a color scheme grouping based off...</p>

             <ul>
               <li style="color: #C1C943;">THESE</li>
               <li style="color: #CC9844;">THREE</li>
               <li style="color: #CC6744;">COLORS</li>
             </ul>

             <p>It will all be light background. The nav might be light text on dark background. I'll also do a wrapper and maybe a gradient on the background outside of the wrapper. All three pages will have matching logo, nav, and footer.</p>

              <p>The homepage will have a big main banner image with text on top and then probably split into a 2/3 left 1/3 right structure.</p>

              <p>The pets subpage will be three columns with photo thumbnails of each pet with the pet's name. Perhaps also I will do a jump to link for the cat thumbnails further down the page.</p>

              <p>The about subpage will probably start with a two-panel split with a photo of Charlie on the left and the backstory on the right. The mission statement will be below along with a few image links. The bottom will be policies and specific contact info.</p>
